# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Initial Memory Bank setup
- Project documentation organization
- Understanding existing codebase structure

## Recent Changes

- Created Memory Bank structure
- Documented project architecture
- Mapped existing features and components

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Review and validate existing API endpoints
2. Assess test coverage
3. Identify potential improvements
4. Plan feature enhancements
5. Set up monitoring and metrics

## Active Considerations

### Technical Priorities

- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Deployment pipeline setup

### Architecture Decisions

- Using Chi router for routing
- GORM as ORM layer
- JWT for authentication
- Docker for containerization
- Feature-based module organization

### Current Trade-offs

1. Simplicity vs. Flexibility

   - Chosen a balanced approach with modular design
   - Core features implemented, room for extension

2. Performance vs. Development Speed

   - Focus on clean architecture
   - Performance optimizations planned for later

3. Security vs. Usability
   - JWT authentication as a balanced solution
   - Additional security measures can be added

## Work in Progress

- Test suite implementation
- API documentation updates
- Performance monitoring setup
- Deployment automation
- Security enhancements

## Known Issues

- None identified yet (initial setup phase)

## Questions to Address

1. What is the target performance benchmark?
2. Are there specific security requirements?
3. What monitoring solutions should be implemented?
4. How should API versioning be handled?
5. What metrics should be tracked?
