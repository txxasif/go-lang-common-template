## Active Considerations

### Technical Priorities

- [ ] Complete service layer implementation
- [ ] Enhance validation system
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Optimize database operations

### Architecture Decisions

- Clean architecture implementation
- Service layer for business logic
- Validation layer for input handling
- Repository pattern for data access
- Middleware for cross-cutting concerns

### Current Trade-offs

1. Development Speed vs. Code Quality

   - Maintaining high code quality while implementing features
   - Balancing immediate needs with long-term maintainability

2. Flexibility vs. Structure

   - Structured approach to service implementation
   - Room for future extensions and modifications

3. Performance vs. Development Speed
   - Focus on clean architecture
   - Performance optimizations planned for later

## Work in Progress

- Service layer implementation
- Validation system enhancement
- Error handling improvements
- Documentation updates
- Monitoring setup

## Known Issues

- Service layer needs completion
- Validation rules need enhancement
- Error handling needs improvement
- Monitoring not yet implemented

## Questions to Address

1. What are the specific validation requirements?
2. How should error handling be standardized?
3. What monitoring metrics are most important?
4. How should service layer be organized?
5. What are the performance requirements?
