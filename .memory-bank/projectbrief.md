# Project Brief: Go API with Chi Router and GORM

## Project Overview

A production-ready Go API boilerplate implementing clean architecture principles, featuring Chi router for routing and GORM for PostgreSQL database operations.

## Core Objectives

1. Provide a scalable and maintainable API structure
2. Implement secure authentication and authorization
3. Follow Go best practices and clean architecture principles
4. Enable easy deployment and containerization
5. Maintain high code quality and testability

## Key Requirements

- Feature-based modular architecture
- JWT-based authentication system
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Docker containerization support
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Secure and efficient data handling

## Success Criteria

1. All API endpoints function as documented
2. Authentication system properly secures protected routes
3. Database operations follow GORM best practices
4. Docker containers deploy successfully
5. Code maintains clean architecture principles
6. Documentation remains up-to-date and accurate
